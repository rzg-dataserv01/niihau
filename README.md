# niihau

Repository for jupyter notebooks. Mainly for 'works in progress' ideas and concepts. Most of these will fall in the category of geoscience workflows/dataflows.

The notebooks are meant to serve these purposes (short-listed):
* streamline the preparation and i/o processes for geoscience datasets
* ensure a greater flexibility of file transfers to/from various geoscience software
* reduce the barrier to using python and other programming languages in the geosciences
* to learn
